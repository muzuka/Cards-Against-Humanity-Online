A socket implementation of Cards Against Humanity in C++ 

The game of Cards Against Humanity is a funny fast-paced
card game about answering questions or filling in blanks
using answers provided. The players take turns being the
judge in which they receive all of the answers and choose
the funniest message. The owner of that message is the 
winner of the round. This can go on forever but usually
ends when the deck of black cards containing questions or
statements runs out.

The game process is as follows:

Step 1: All of the players receive their white cards.
Step 2: A new judge is chosen.
Step 3: A new black card is chosen containing the new question.
Step 4: All of the non-judge players choose an answer.
Step 5: Answers are given to the judge.
Step 6: The judge chooses the best one.
Step 7: Owner of the chosen white card gets a point.
Step 8: Return to step 2.

How to setup the game:
########################################################

Prerequisites: 
Card.h Card.cpp Player.cpp Player.h Server.cpp Client.cpp Makefile
(text file of black cards) (text file of white cards)
All of the above files must be in the same directory to work.

Step 1: Compile the program by typing "make" into the command
line while in the directory containing all of the required files.

Step 2: There must be four players connected at once for the game
to start so open at least five terminals that are all in the same
directory.

Step 3: Choose a terminal and start the server. The server requires
a port number, a file name for the black deck, and a file name for
the white deck. Type: ./Server <Port Number> <BlackDeck> <WhiteDeck>

Step 4: On all of the other terminals start the clients. The client
requires the IP address of the server and the matching port number.
Type: ./Client <IP Address> <Port Number>

Step 5: Each client will ask for a name. The name must not have spaces
or match another client's name.

Step 6: Once all of the required players have joined a judge will be
chosen. The other players will be able to see a menu and make selections.
The player can choose an answer, demo an answer, look at their hand, see
their score, or quit the game.

Step 7: Once all the choices have been made the judge will be able to
see a menu and make choices. The judge can choose an answer, demo an
answer, look at the answers, see his/her current score, or quit the game.

Step 8: After the judge has chosen the next round starts. Any new players
join as well. Go back to step 6 and repeat for the entire game.
